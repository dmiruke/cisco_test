getMacInfo.py 
    python getMacInfo.py <mac-address>
    - it validates Mac address
    - if the MAC address is correct it will return the company name 
    - To run the script do
      python ./getMacInfo.py <mac-address>

Dockerfile 
    - this contains the recipe for creating the docker container to run  the code

To build docker container and run it do 
    - docker build -t cisco_test . 
    - docker run <mac-address>

Security Aspects:
    - The apiKey is stored in the code directly in plain text which is normally a security risk
      But assumption here is that the docker registry will provide authenticated access to run the docker images
    - The apiKey can be stored in a secure store like Valut,  and can be queried using REST API
    - the docker image can be sent through virus scanner or applied traps, which will prevent its  use by malware or inject malware in it
    - the docker image is run inside a host, in a different namespace, but still are running on the host, so having a security hardened host is important
      this can be accomplished with
       - secure access to the host
       - log scanning and alert monitoring
       - implementing the network security,including IDS  best practices on the network on which the host is running
     - The container should not run with root privilege
     - The container images should be hardened
